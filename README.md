# Python chat

This is a simple server - client chat app in python.

The files 'client_bless.py' and 'blessings_test.py' are here for testing purposes, the 'working' parts are 'client.py' for the client, where you just have to replace the IP with your local IP address and the 'server.py', which should work with no configuration.
